<p>Eilean Donan is the name of a popular castle in Scotland that I visited in summer. Founded in 13th century, the castle has many displays of medieval books, paintings, furnitures, etc.

While browsing around, my attention was immediately caught by this shiny artefact of a preserved leg of an eagle that has been beautifully decorated with jewellery and diamonds. It truly expressed the power of King Alexander II. Therefore, I wanted to portray these elements in my painting.

The focus of painting is the shiny blue diamond and gold chains. Whereas the contrast between the black background and the purple ribbons, wavy leaves and dark roses altogether add mystical and mysterious senses to the painting.</p>
