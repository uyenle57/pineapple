<p>Hello, good to see you here! 👋🏼
<br/><br/>
Originally from Ho Chi Minh City and currently working in London as a software engineer, I'm passionate about technology and the environment.
<br/><br/>
Outside of work I enjoy working on side projects, where I recently built <a href="https://howtoreduceplastic.com">How To Reduce Plastic</a> to learn Front-end development and inspire everyone to reduce plastic. I also run an accompanying Instagram page <a href="https://instagram.com/howtoreduceplastic">@howtoreduceplastic</a>.
<br/><br/>
I also enjoy dancing, reading books and volunteering for environmental non-profit organisations.</p>
<br/><br/>
Feel free to drop me an email if you'd like to chat!
