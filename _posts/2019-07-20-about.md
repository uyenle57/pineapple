<p>Hello, good to see you here! 👋🏼
<br/><br/>
Grew up in Saigon and currently living and working in London as a Software engineer, I'm passionate about technology, art, food and the environment.
<br/><br/>
Outside of work I enjoy working on side projects, where I recently built <a href="https://howtoreduceplastic.com">How To Reduce Plastic</a> to learn Front-end development and inspire everyone to reduce plastic. I also run an accompanying Instagram page <a href="https://instagram.com/howtoreduceplastic">@howtoreduceplastic</a>.
<br/><br/>
I also dance, read books and draw sometimes <a href="https://instagram.com/drawnbyuyen">@drawnbyuyen</a>.
