<p>Hello, good to see you here! 👋🏼
<br/><br/>
Born in Saigon and currently living in London as a software engineer, I'm passionate in utilising cutting-edge technology to help reduce environmental impacts and create a greener, healthier world.
<br/><br/>
Outside of work, I enjoy being outdoors and staying active, where I spend most of my free time visiting new parks, dancing, reading and cooking.
I also enjoy working on side projects, where I built <a href="https://howtoreduceplastic.com">How To Reduce Plastic</a> to inspire others to reduce plastic and learn ReactJS.  
<br/><br/>
Feel free to drop me an email if you'd like to chat!
